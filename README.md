# Hi! ðŸ‘‹ðŸ§‘ I'm Sam

I am a data enthusiast living in Brooklyn, New York. My ideal project is something that exists at the intersection of data science and public policy. I feel particularly passionate about improving access to high-quality, affordable housing and healthcare. If they idea of making government work better for the general people by crunching on big data sounds encouraging to you, then maybe we should collaborate!
